Hello, I'm Venat! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently a student at George Mason University, and I'm passionate about coding and learning new technologies. My goal is to build innovative projects that push the boundaries of what I can create, while also constantly improving my skills.

As part of my learning journey, Iâ€™m studying web development through a fantastic Udemy course by Angela Yu. This repository showcases some of the projects and exercises Iâ€™m working on as I dive deeper into the world of web development.

I also keep track of my learning progress, resources, and ideas in Notion, where I write notes and share tips that might be helpful to others. Feel free to check out my Notion page for more insights and study materials.
